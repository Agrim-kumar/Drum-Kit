# HTML/CSS/JS & DOM - Drum Kit.
This is a simple drum kit web application that allows users to play drums by pressing specific keys on their keyboard. It's a fun project to play around with and can be a great learning tool for those who are new to web development.
## Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://agrim-kumar.github.io/Drum-Kit/).
